This repository contains two folders (DM1 and DM2), in which I have uploaded part of my work regarding two data mining challenges from the Kaggle website. 

The first project consists of predicting wether a vehicle bought from an auction will result in bad buy (lemon) or a good buy. Prediction is done based on over 30 different attributes such as vehicle age, manufacturer, transmission etc. 

The second project consists (among other things) of a time series analysis of the San Francisco homicide rate throughout the 80s and 90s.

Both projects were writen in Python using the Jupyter web framework. The file extensions are ".ipynb". I have also included the reports for both projects, detailing the steps followed for every obtained result.
